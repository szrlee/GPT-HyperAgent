# Usage

To run the experiment on Neural Bandit, use the following command:
```
python -m scripts.run_hyper --game Neural --method Hyper
```

To run the experiment on Online Automated Content Moderation, use this command:
```
python -m scripts.run_llm --game hatespeech --model-type=linear --llm-name=gpt2
```

HyperAgent for deep reinforcement learning can be found in the repo [szrlee/HyperAgent](https://github.com/szrlee/HyperAgent).
