Welcome to the official implementation of **GPT-HyperAgent**, a cutting-edge algorithm designed for adaptive foundation models in online decision-making. This repository accompanies our paper [Adaptive Foundation Models for Online Decisions: HyperAgent with Fast Incremental Uncertainty Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195).

GPT-HyperAgent aims to address the challenges of scalable exploration and fast incremental uncertainty estimation in large-scale online decision environments.

## Key Features

- **Fast Incremental Uncertainty Estimation:** Ensures quick updates and reliable uncertainty quantification with logarithmic per-step computational complexity.
- **Scalable Exploration:** Efficiently handles large state-action spaces, facilitating robust and adaptive exploration while matching the regret order of exact Thompson sampling.
- **Integration with GPT Models:** Utilizes the strengths of GPT architectures to enhance decision-making processes in contextual bandits with natural language input.

## Getting Started

To get started with HyperAgent, refer to the detailed documentation and examples provided in this repository. For large-scale deep RL benchmarking results and details, visit the [szrlee/HyperAgent](https://github.com/szrlee/HyperAgent) repository.

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help improve and expand the capabilities of HyperAgent.

- To run the experiment on Neural Bandit, use the following command:
```
python -m scripts.run_hyper --game Neural --method Hyper
```

- To run the experiment on Online Automated Content Moderation, use this command:
```
python -m scripts.run_llm --game hatespeech --model-type=linear --llm-name=gpt2
```

HyperAgent for deep reinforcement learning can be found in the repo [szrlee/HyperAgent](https://github.com/szrlee/HyperAgent).
